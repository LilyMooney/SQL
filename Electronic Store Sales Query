#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tabes in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT (orderID) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(quantity) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE product = 'iPhone';
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT acctnum 
    FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
    ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID;
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, Sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product;
    
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Sattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, (price*quantity) as revenue, location 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
    GROUP BY product;
    
#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price) 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
    ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
    WHERE Feb.quantity > 2;
